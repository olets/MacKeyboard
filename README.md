# MacKeyboard

A Mac mapping for Windows keyboards, perfect for Mac users who dip into other OSes

- Changes the behavior of the Alt, Windows, and Contextual Menu keys
- Adds behaviors to one of the Ctrl keys

## Use, Customization, and Limitations

MacKeyboard is an AutoHotKey ([www.autohotkey.com](http://www.autohotkey.com/)) script. Install AHK and
double click this file (make it and yourself happy by adding it to startup items).

- MacKeyboard is optimized for users who mouse/trackpad with their right hand, and use the left-hand Ctrl key
for right clicking. If you want to use the right-hand Ctrl key for right clicking
you'll need to swap all LCtrl's and RCtrl's.

- Alt-Tab (Mac "Command-Tab") is now mapped to Windows-Tab and Contextual Menu-Tab
  (shouldn't be an issue for small keyboards, where the Windows and Contextual Menu
  buttons are close to the thumbs, and Alt is narrow)
- Left and right arrow keys escape (Shift-)Alt-Tab instead of changing the selection.
  (see end of file for my latest attempt)

## This isn't what I wanted!

Wrong direction? [Mac Keyboard Fixer](https://github.com/richard4339/Mac-Keyboard-Fixer)
will remap a *Mac* keyboard to feel more like *Windows*.
