A Mac mapping for the Dell Mini 10v keyboard
Changes the behavior of the Alt, Windows, and Contextual Menu keys
Adds behaviors to one of the Ctrl keys
Developed and tested only in Windows 7 on a Dell 1011 (Mini 10v)

USE: This is an AutoHotKey script (.ahk), which needs AutoHotKey to run. I recommend
adding MacKeyboard to the Startup items.

NOTE: I mouse/trackpad with my right hand, and use the left-hand Ctrl key
for right clicking. If you want to use the right-hand Ctrl key for right clicking
you'll need to swap all LCtrl's and RCtrl's.

LIMITATIONS:
- Alt-Tab (Mac "Command-Tab") is now mapped to Windows-Tab and Contextual Menu-Tab
  (shouldn't be an issue for small keyboards, where the Windows and Contextual Menu
  buttons are close to the thumbs, and Alt is narrow)
- Left and right arrow keys escape (Shift-)Alt-Tab instead of changing the selection.
